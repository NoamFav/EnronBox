## 1 Motivation and problem statement (500 words max)

Provide a concise description of: What is the exact problem you try to solve? Why is it important to solve this problem? Provide the necessary context. Support your claims with references!

## 2 Research questions (at least 3 concrete research questions)

What are the research questions you are trying to answer? Please note that we expect more than one vague research question here. Make sure to have relevant and concrete research questions. Check, whether you can answer your research question using experiments. The research questions should be SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound).

## 3 Chosen approaches (700 words max)

Describe your chosen approach. Argue properly based on scientific literature and state-of-the-art, why
your chosen approaches are feasible to solve the problem at hand. You should explain: which algorithms you choose for which reason, involved/required datasets and how you validate your approaches. Provide references to approaches you are reusing or adapting (e.g. existing software tools, algorithms, datasets, libraries). You do not have to develop everything from scratch. Instead concentrate on the interesting aspects of your work. After reading this section, examiners should understand what you will be doing, what your groupsâ€™ contribution will be (in addition to what the existing software already provides) and whether your proposed approaches match the intended learning outcomes of the project.

## 4 Experiments (300 words max)

What experiments are you planning to conduct using the chosen approaches that will help to answer your research questions? Make sure that for each research question, you have a plan on how to conduct the experiments to be able to answer it. No research question without experiment and no experiment without a link to a research question!!

## 5 Related work (500 words max)

Compare your approaches to related work. References to scientific literature and professional projects
are required. It is essential that you compare your approach and do not just describe the work of others.
It should become clear what you do differently and which ideas you are borrowing.

## 6 Relation of proposal to courses in your curriculum (50 words max)

Mention, how the proposal is connected to courses in your curriculum. Concentrate especially on the courses you have in the current semester.

## 7 Planning (2 Gantt Charts in a readable format)

Provide one Gantt Chart for project phases 2 and 3 each. We understand that the planning for phase 3 might not yet be too detailed but it should be clear, what your ambitions are for phase 2 and how you would like to use phase 3 to further enhance your approaches. An example planning can be found on Canvas.

## 8 Minimal passing requirements (50 words max)

Mention what you think should be the minimal passing requirements or what you think are still acceptable outcomes of your project. Think in terms of the product itself (what approaches need to be there) and the validation (what research questions need to be answered by providing the corresponding research questions). Please note that we in any case expect a proper scientific work (motivation of choices, no plagiarism, individual understanding of the project etc.), a scientific report following the guidelines and a well-designed presentation).

## 9 References (no limit, but at least 10 references)

Use a commonly used style for your references. Be consistent.
